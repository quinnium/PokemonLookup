Simple 'take home' project (app) to download Pokemon data from an API and display basic stats for each pokemon.

With more time, the next tasks would be to (in order of priority):
- Support Image caching
- Support offline viewing, using a persistant storage framework such as SwiftData or other database solution
- Support download of futher information types on each Pokemon (currently only 'stats' and 'weight' are supported)
